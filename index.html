        <p>The "story of flowers" can refer to several different works, including a book by Noel Kingsbury<br>
            and animated films by Azuma Makoto, both of which explore the relationship between humans and flowers. <br>
            The book details the historical and cultural significance of 100 different flowers, while the animated
            projects focus on the life cycle of flowers and the <br>
            cultural/emotional connection between humans and them. The phrase can also be a general term for the deep,
            long-standing relationship between humans and flowers, encompassing their use in food, <br>
            medicine, art, symbolism, and decoration throughout history</p>
